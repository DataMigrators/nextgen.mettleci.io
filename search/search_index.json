The data could simulate what would be produced by the real surrogate key generator if it had processed the test case input records, however it doesn\u2019t have to.  The easiest way to simulate the surrogate key generator output records would be to copy the CSV specified in the <code>then</code> clause and add a new column to represent the generated key and set appropriate key values.</p>","tags":["DataStage","Creating Tests"]},{"location":"patterns/testing-datastage-surrogate-key-generators/#flow-design","title":"Flow design","text":"","tags":["DataStage","Creating Tests"]},{"location":"patterns/testing-datastage-surrogate-key-generators/#test-specification","title":"Test specification","text":"<pre><code>{\n   \"given\": [\n      {\n         \"stage\": \"KeyGenerator\",\n         \"link\": \"Output\",\n         \"path\": \"KeyGenerator-Output.csv\"\n      }\n   ],\n   \"when\": {\n      \"parameters\": {\n         \"MyKeyStartValue\": 100\n      }\n   },\n   \"then\": [\n      {\n         \"stage\": \"KeyGenerator\",\n         \"link\": \"Input\",\n         \"path\": \"KeyGenerator-Input.csv\"\n      }\n   ]\n}\n</code></pre>","tags":["DataStage","Creating Tests"]},{"location":"patterns/testing-datastage-surrogate-key-generators/#result","title":"Result","text":"","tags":["DataStage","Creating Tests"]},{"location":"patterns/testing-flows-using-datetime-references/","title":"Testing flows using date/time references","text":"<p>Repeatable DataStage tests require that the flow being tested produces deterministic data based on a set of predefined inputs and parameters.

It is provided as a convenient alternative to explicitly replacing Sparse Lookup stage input and output links, allowing the remaining logic in the job to be tested while not actually testing the behaviour of DataStage\u2019s Sparse Lookup stage.  \n\nWhen generating Unit Tests from Job designs containing Sparse Lookups, MettleCI Workbench version 1.0-1483 and later will automatically apply this Unit Test pattern and generate test specifications which replace Sparse Lookup stages entirely.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\nReplacing the Sparse Lookup stage with a Unit Test version of the sparse lookup comes with some limitations that DataStage developers should keep in mind.  \n\nUnit Test Sparse Lookup stages simulate typical key matching and assumes data equality with three-valued-logic semantics.  Custom key-matching logic embedded in custom lookup SQL (eg. SQL with a where clause like where KEY_COLUMN=Upper(ORCHESTRATE.KEY_COLUMN)) will not be replicated.\n\nWhen running Unit Testing in Interception mode, one additional Sort operation per Unit Test Sparse Lookup stage is required.  For sparse lookup stages which produce large volumes of output data this can have an adverse affect on job execution times when running in Interception mode.\n\nReference data records that contain Nulls or Default Values for all columns are ignored during interception when the Sparse Lookup stage is set to Continue on Lookup Failure.  This will have no functional impact on the output of the Sparse Lookup Stage and is expected behaviour.\n\nWhere you consider these limitations unacceptable you can revert to the original (explicit) method for replacing Sparse Lookups.\n\nA pragmatic approach for Multiple Sparse Lookups\nFor jobs where the vast majority of job logic is implemented using Sparse Lookup stages, replacing all lookups with Unit Test data would result in little-to-no DataStage logic being tested (as illustrated below).  \n\nOpen image-20200129-035608.png\n\nFor the type of Job design show above, a traditional explicit testing approach would necessitate the developer providing 8 sets of test data! An alternative testing approach is to leave the Sparse Lookups in place and replace only the input and output stages with Unit Test data.  A live Database connection will be required during testing but the when clause can be used to set job parameters that dictate database connection settings. \n\nTechnically this is an Integration Test, not a Unit Test: The Unit Test Harness does not provide any functionality for populating database reference tables with Unit Test data prior to test execution, users are responsible for managing Integration Test setup and tear down through governance and/or CI/CD pipeline customisation.\n\nOpen image-20200129-040758.png\n\n \n</code></pre> given:   - stage: Source     link: Input     path: Source-Output.csv when:   parameters:     DbName: MyUnitTestDb     DbUser: MyUnitTestUser     DbPass: {iisenc}dKANDae233DJIQeiidm== then:   - stage: Target     link: Output     path: Target-Output.csv ```</p> <p>Open image-20200129-040641.png</p>","tags":["DataStage","Creating Tests"]},{"location":"testing/test-specification-format/","title":"DataStage test specification format","text":"<ul> <li>Structure overview</li> <li>Given these inputs</li> <li>Sparse Lookup sources</li> <li>When these conditions are met</li> <li>Then expect these outputs</li> </ul>","tags":["DataStage","Creating Tests"]},{"location":"testing/test-specification-format/#structure","title":"Structure","text":"<p>A DataStage\u00ae test case specification (often abbreviated \u2018Spec') is a JSON-formatted file which uses a grammar modelled loosely on the Gherkin syntax used by the Cucumber testing tool.
